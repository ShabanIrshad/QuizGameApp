# Quiz Game – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Built a fully functional quiz application with dynamic questions, scoring logic, and negative marking (-0.25) system.

- Created an attractive UI/UX with styled question cards, option buttons, result tables, and rule guidelines.

- Applied responsive design techniques (flex/grid layouts, percentage widths, Google Fonts) to ensure cross-device compatibility.

- Designed modular game flow (Rules → Play → Results → Restart) simulating a real test environment.
